# Salary Prediction - Machine Learning Project  

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict salaries based on given input features. Using Linear Regression, the model learns from historical salary data and identifies patterns to make accurate predictions.  

## Key Features:  
- Implements **Linear Regression** for salary prediction.  
- Trained on relevant salary datasets to improve accuracy.  
- Performs **data preprocessing** to handle missing values and outliers.  
- Provides salary estimates based on input parameters like **experience, education,** and other factors.  

This project demonstrates the application of **supervised learning** in regression analysis and can be further improved with additional features and advanced models.
